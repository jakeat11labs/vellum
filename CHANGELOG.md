## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - June 11, 2026

### Added
- **Precise element targeting via the HyperFrames picker.** When the injected runtime exposes `__HF_PICKER_API` (the same element inspector Studio's layers panel uses), notes now capture an exact CSS selector, a human-readable label, the element's bounding box, and its `data-*` attributes (including `data-start`/`data-duration`) — so the agent gets an addressable element instead of a fuzzy tag/class/text guess. Older runtimes fall back to the previous heuristic automatically.
- **Live hover highlight while arming.** With ＋ Add note armed, the element under the crosshair gets a teal outline and a floating name tag before you click — no more pinning blind.
- **Overlap disambiguation in the composer.** When several elements stack under the pin point, the composer's target line becomes a dropdown of all candidates (topmost first); picking one flashes that element in the composition to confirm the choice.
- **Flash-to-verify on notes.** Hovering a note row, pin, or region flashes its target element in the note's own color; clicking seeks to the note's time and then flashes — instant confirmation a note still points at the right thing after edits.
- **Element outlines in review packets.** `vellum-review` now draws the target element's actual bounding box (plus a small dot at the click point) for pin notes that captured one, instead of the generic 40px square.

### Changed
- **Region notes capture their target at the box center** rather than the drag-start corner — the element a box surrounds is the subject, not whatever was under the first click.
- `annotations.md` lines append `· at \`<selector>\`` when an exact selector was captured, and the agent skill now instructs agents to prefer `target.selector` over the tag/class/text triple.

## [0.3.7] - June 11, 2026

### Added
- **Per-note colors.** Each note gets its own stable color from a 12-color palette (mapped by note id, so a note keeps its color for life). Pins, region boxes, their badges, and the notes-panel rows all share that color, making notes easy to tell apart at a glance.
- **Timeline note dots.** A colored dot sits above the scrubber at each note's point on the timeline, matching that note's color — click one to jump straight to it. Hover to preview `note-N · time — text`.
- **Scene-break ghost lines.** Faint vertical ticks on the scrubber mark where each scene begins, so you can see where ⏮/⏭ (and ↑/↓) will land the playhead before you jump. Hover a tick for the scene name and timestamp.

### Changed
- **Pins, regions, and dots brighten in their own color on hover** (with a matching glow), replacing the old fixed teal/white hover state now that markers are individually colored.
- **README leads with the demo.** Added the 52-second promo video (poster + link) to the hero and "Try the demo" sections, plus an animated terminal GIF (`assets/vellum-tui.gif`) showing the `vellum` startup — logo banner, status panel, and live note feed.

## [0.3.6] - June 11, 2026

### Changed
- **Installer banner now wears the logo.** The blue→purple layered "V" mark (`assets/logo-mark.png`) is recreated as truecolor half-block pixel art beside the VELLUM letters, and the same gradient sweeps the letters — blue on the V through purple on the M, light at the top fading deep below. Terminals 60–75 columns wide get the gradient letters without the mark; non-truecolor terminals keep the previous teal banner; piped/`NO_COLOR` output stays plain.
- **`◆ vellum` wordmark matches the logo.** New blue→purple `brandGradient()` in `scripts/vellum-ui.mjs`, used by the server, updater, and review wordmark. Teal accents elsewhere (rules, spinners, progress bars) unchanged.

## [0.3.5] - June 11, 2026

### Added
- **Terminal UI overhaul.** New zero-dependency `scripts/vellum-ui.mjs` toolkit: teal-gradient brand styling on truecolor terminals (256/16-color fallbacks, `NO_COLOR` honored, plain text when piped), rounded boxes, spinners, progress bars, and OSC-8 clickable links.
- **Live activity feed.** The review server now logs each event as it happens — note added/edited/resolved/reopened/deleted, notes cleared, mix saved — with timestamps, instead of sitting silent while you review.
- **Session summary on Ctrl+C.** Stopping the server prints how many notes were saved (open vs. done) and where, plus the agent handoff prompt.

### Changed
- **Server startup panel.** Gradient `◆ vellum` wordmark and a boxed status panel with a clickable review URL, composition, runtime source, and notes path (shows saved-note count when resuming a review).
- **`vellum update` polish.** Animated spinner while checking, styled `v0.3.x → v0.3.y` version diff, and clear up-to-date / available / failed states.
- **`vellum-review` progress.** Live progress bar with per-note ✓/✗ result lines while frames render (plain numbered lines when piped).
- **Installer redesign.** Teal-gradient VELLUM banner (compact fallback on narrow/no-color terminals), sectioned steps (`── Project check ──`, `── Review tool ──`, `── Agent skill ──`), one-line download progress instead of seven repeated "installed" lines, styled prompts/choice lists, and a cleaner "Vellum is ready" summary.

## [0.3.4] - June 11, 2026

### Changed
- **Control bar redesigned** — single fixed row that never wraps. Logo is now an inline SVG V mark with a teal glow (no more faint-on-dark PNG). Controls grouped by function with hairline separators: transport · scrub+timecode+scene · audio mix · actions. Secondary buttons (Copy prompt, Clear all) are icon-only. "Save mix" → "Mix", emoji audio labels → compact "VO"/"MX" text. Scrubber gets all remaining width.

## [0.3.3] - June 11, 2026

### Changed
- **Runtime is resolved dynamically, not by hardcoded filename.** The player now fetches the HyperFrames runtime from a stable `/__vellum/runtime.js` endpoint; the server globs the real build out of a local `node_modules/hyperframes` → npx cache → CDN. Survives a future runtime rename instead of hardcoding `dist/hyperframe.runtime.iife.js` on the client.
- **Audio bed detection honors an explicit `data-vellum-audio="music"|"voice"`** attribute on `<audio>` elements, falling back to the previous id/longest-clip heuristic.

### Added
- **Automatic port fallback.** If the default port (4848) is busy, the server hops to the next free port instead of crashing with `EADDRINUSE`. An explicit `VELLUM_PORT` is still honored exactly (clear error if taken).

## [0.3.2] - June 11, 2026

### Fixed
- Review player now locates the composition root by its `data-composition-id` attribute instead of requiring a literal `id="root"`. Compositions whose root element uses a different id (e.g. `id="stage"`) now mount correctly instead of failing with "no #root composition in index.html". Scene detection and the pin hit-test use the same lookup.

## [0.3.1] - June 11, 2026

### Fixed
- Installer no longer aborts under `set -e` right after installing the agent skill. On a root-composition install (no `--dir`, no existing `.vellum.env`), `write_vellum_env` ended on a `[ -f .vellum.env ] && rm -f …` test that returned non-zero, killing the script before the global `vellum` command was installed and before the "Start Vellum now?" step. Root-composition installs now complete cleanly.

## [0.3.0] - June 11, 2026

### Added
- **`vellum update`** — checks the published version and, when newer, updates the install in place by re-running the installer non-interactively while preserving your config (skill target, `VELLUM_DIR`/port). `vellum update --check` reports only; `--force` reinstalls. Adds `vellum version` too.
- **HyperFrames runtime resolution for `npx`-style projects** — when `node_modules/hyperframes` isn't installed (e.g. lessons that run `npx hyperframes@x`), the review server now serves the injected runtime from the npx cache (matching the version in `package.json`) or redirects to the jsDelivr CDN, so the composition mounts instead of failing to load. The startup banner shows the runtime source.

### Changed
- Installer sets up the global `vellum` command by default and no longer prompts for it (`--no-bin` / `VELLUM_INSTALL_BIN=0` still opt out).
- Agent-skill picker: **Claude Code** now installs to `.claude/skills` only; **Both** creates the canonical `.agents/skills` copy plus a `.claude/skills` symlink. Cursor/Codex/Windsurf unchanged.

### Fixed
- README license badge is now a static badge, avoiding shields.io "unable to select next github token from pool" errors.

## [0.2.0] - June 11, 2026

### Added
- **Global `vellum` command** — installer drops a shim into `~/.local/bin` (plus `vellum-review`) that walks up from your cwd, finds `scripts/vellum-server.mjs`, and reads `.vellum.env` for defaults.
- **Project launcher** (`scripts/vellum`) and shared module (`scripts/vellum-shared.mjs`) for composition resolution, formatting, and path guards.
- **Browser auto-open** on start (`--no-open` or `VELLUM_OPEN=0` to disable).
- **Note editing API** — `PATCH /api/notes/:id` for inline text edits and status (`open` | `resolved` | `wontfix`); stable `note-<id>` prefixes in `annotations.md` and review-packet filenames.
- **Player QoL** — **N** add-note shortcut, **Copy prompt**, inline edit, status cycle, responsive control bar.
- **Guided installer** — composition picker, install-mode menu, `--start`, `--no-bin`, `.vellum.env` defaults, gitignore prompt for `notes/` + `snapshots/`.
- **Agent skill routing** — installer asks which coding agent you use; skill installs to `.agents/skills/vellum/` by default; Claude Code gets `.claude/skills/vellum/` as a symlink to the same copy.
- **CI** — GitHub Actions workflow runs `npm test` on push and PR.
- `vellum-review` bin entry in `package.json`, so package installs expose both commands.
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes on the CDN GSAP script tags in the demo composition.
- Installer options: `--dir`, `--port`, `--tool-only`, `--skill-only`, `--no-prompt`, and `--no-package`, plus subdir-aware npm script generation.
- Smoke tests for the server API, range requests, `VELLUM_DIR` guard, installer subdir wiring, global shim discovery, and skill symlink layout.

### Removed
- **Promo video** (`promo/`) — the embedded HyperFrames marketing composition and its assets were removed to keep the package focused on the review tooling and demo composition.
- Stale `Vellum-code.txt` monolith.

### Changed
- **README overhauled**: hook-first hero, quickstart above the fold, `vellum` command docs, a "What your agent sees" sample of `annotations.md`, merged agent-handoff section, and an "Under the hood" section with security/playback guarantees.
- README keyboard table now correctly describes arrow-key scrubbing as 0.1s steps (Shift = 1s).
- shadcn registry skill target moved to `.agents/skills/vellum/SKILL.md`.
- Package scripts now include `vellum`, `vellum:review`, and `test`, with `annotate` / `review` kept as aliases.
- The review player now reads `data-width` / `data-height` from the composition instead of assuming 1920×1080.
- Agent skill documents the `note-<id>` workflow, PATCH/status handling, and `.agents/skills` install path.

### Fixed
- `examples/demo` scene visibility is now timeline-driven (opacity crossfades), so `hyperframes snapshot` and `vellum-review` packets show the correct scene — the static-render path does not toggle `data-start` clip visibility. Also documented this as a heads-up in the README.
- Single-note delete now uses `DELETE /api/notes/:id` instead of clearing and reposting all notes.
- Hardened `VELLUM_DIR` path handling, oversized request responses, note/mix numeric bounds, suffix range requests, and review-packet failure exits.
- Installer fixes for `set -e` subshell returns, bin-shim prompt ordering, and non-TTY multi-composition prompts.

## [0.1.0] - June 10, 2026

Initial release — a transparent review-and-annotate layer for HyperFrames videos.

### Added
- **Review player** that mounts your real `index.html` composition in an iframe via the HyperFrames runtime — works with any composition, no per-project configuration. Scenes are read from the `data-start` attributes every composition already has.
- **Point pins and region boxes**: click a spot or drag a box on any frame to attach a note. Each note captures the composition time, the on-screen element it points at (tag, class, text), and pin/box coordinates.
- **Notes persisted to disk** at `<composition>/notes/` as `annotations.json` (structured) and `annotations.md` (human-readable cue sheet) for a coding agent to read.
- **Live audio mix** — voice/music sliders with a "Save mix" that writes `notes/mix.json` to bake into `data-volume`. Levels are re-asserted every frame, and each audio clip is kept seek-accurate so scrubbing into the middle of a clip still plays.
- **Scene-aware markers** (a pin only shows while its own scene is on screen), keyboard transport (play/scrub/frame-step), and scene jumping.
- **Visual review packet** (`vellum-review.mjs`): renders the composition frame at each note's time with the pin/box drawn on it, into `notes/review/`.
- **Companion agent skill** (`.claude/skills/vellum`) that teaches a coding agent to read the notes and apply them, deferring to the `hyperframes` / `hyperframes-cli` skills for the actual edits.
- **One-command installer** — `curl -fsSL …/install.sh | sh` drops the tool into `scripts/`, the agent skill into `.claude/skills/vellum/`, and wires `npm run vellum`.
- **shadcn GitHub registry** manifest (`registry.json`) distributing the tool and the skill as separate items.
- **Example composition** (`examples/demo/`) — a self-contained sample for trying Vellum immediately.
- **Brand assets** — logo, transparent mark, banner, generated social preview (1280×640), and favicon; the mark is embedded in the player as favicon and bar icon.

### Security
- Local-only by design: the server binds to `127.0.0.1`, sends no CORS headers, guards against path traversal, validates and length-caps note input, and invokes external tools (`hyperframes`, `ffmpeg`) with argument arrays only.
